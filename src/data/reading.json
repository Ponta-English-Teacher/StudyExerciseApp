    "original": "Parenting is full of uncertainty. No one receives formal training before becoming a parent, and each child is different. Parents often learn by doing, making mistakes, and adjusting their methods.\n\nMany books promise perfect solutions for raising successful children. But these often reflect the unique experiences of the authors and their own children. In real life, parents must deal with immediate challenges like comforting a crying baby or managing daily routines. They learn on the job, and that\u2019s what makes parenting both difficult and deeply personal.",
    "simplified": "Being a parent is not easy. Parents don\u2019t go to school to learn how to raise children. Each child is different, so parents must learn by trying and changing what they do.\n\nSome books give advice about raising smart or successful children. But what works in the book may not work for others. Parents often have to help crying babies or solve small problems every day. They learn while doing it. This is why parenting is hard but also special.",

Developing good sleep habits\u2014like keeping a regular bedtime and avoiding screens late at night\u2014can significantly improve overall well-being.",
