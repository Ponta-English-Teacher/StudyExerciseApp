    "original": "Teenagers today are often sleep-deprived due to busy school schedules, social activities, and screen time before bed. However, sleep plays a vital role in both mental and physical development. Experts recommend that teens get at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night, yet many are getting far less.\n\nA lack of sleep can lead to problems with concentration, mood, and academic performance. Long-term sleep deprivation is also linked to more serious health issues, such as obesity, depression, and a weakened immune system. Developing good sleep habits—like keeping a regular bedtime and avoiding screens late at night—can significantly improve overall well-being.",
    "simplified": "Many teenagers don’t sleep enough. They are busy with school, friends, and using phones at night. But sleep is very important for the body and mind. Doctors say teenagers should sleep for 8 to 10 hours, but many do not.\n\nIf teenagers don’t sleep well, they may feel tired and sad. They may not do well in school. If this continues, it can cause health problems like getting sick more easily. It’s a good idea to sleep at the same time every night and not look at phones before bed.",
