    "original": "Teenagers today are often sleep-deprived due to busy school schedules, social activities, and screen time before bed. However, sleep plays a vital role in both mental and physical development. Experts recommend that teens get at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night, yet many are getting far less.\n\nA lack of sleep can lead to problems with concentration, mood, and academic performance. Long-term sleep deprivation is also linked to more serious health issues, such as obesity, depression, and a weakened immune system. Developing good sleep habits—like keeping a regular bedtime and avoiding screens late at night—can significantly improve overall well-being.",
    "simplified": "Many teenagers don’t sleep enough. They are busy with school, friends, and using phones at night. But sleep is very important for the body and mind. Doctors say teenagers should sleep for 8 to 10 hours, but many do not.\n\nIf teenagers don’t sleep well, they may feel tired and sad. They may not do well in school. If this continues, it can cause health problems like getting sick more easily. It’s a good idea to sleep at the same time every night and not look at phones before bed.",

  "original": "Today, men who engage in parenting and cooking are respected and valued. These tasks are often seen as natural for women, but in fact no one is born with such skills. Cooking and raising children must be learned through practice. For many years, women have had more chances to learn, simply because men stayed away. As a result, women often became more skilled, while men missed out. If fathers continue to avoid these roles, they will not only create an unfair burden for women but also limit their own growth.\n\nParenting and cooking are not simple duties. They are creative and enjoyable experiences. Cooking means thinking carefully: what food is left in the refrigerator, what the family enjoys, and how to prepare tomorrow’s lunch. Parenting means sharing joy, solving problems, and teaching children by example. These activities require attention, patience, and imagination. Men should take part not only to support women, but also for themselves. By learning these skills, men become more capable, and the whole family becomes stronger and happier.",

Cooking is creative: thinking about what food is left, what the family likes, and how to make a good meal. Fathers can spend time with children, and children can learn from them. Men should do more, not only to help women, but also for themselves. By learning these skills, men can grow, and families can become fair and happy.",

  "original": "When you read a passage or listen to someone speak, it is natural to find words you do not know. Many learners believe they must understand every single word. However, this is not true. Good readers and listeners often guess the meaning from context. They look at the other words, the sentence, or the situation, and make a smart guess. This skill is even more important in real-life communication, where there is no dictionary to help you.\n\nYou can also guess from the topic. For example, if the title is about smartphones and young people, you can predict it might be about using smartphones too much and the negative effects. If your guess is correct, you will understand faster. If it is wrong, you can quickly switch to a new guess. Focusing too much on difficult words can slow you down and make you lose the main idea. Even native speakers do not know every word, but they still understand by guessing. Developing this skill makes you more confident and helps you enjoy English without fear.",
