    "original": "Teenagers today are often sleep-deprived due to busy school schedules, social activities, and screen time before bed. However, sleep plays a vital role in both mental and physical development. Experts recommend that teens get at least 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night, yet many are getting far less.\n\nA lack of sleep can lead to problems with concentration, mood, and academic performance. Long-term sleep deprivation is also linked to more serious health issues, such as obesity, depression, and a weakened immune system. Developing good sleep habits—like keeping a regular bedtime and avoiding screens late at night—can significantly improve overall well-being.",
    "simplified": "Many teenagers don’t sleep enough. They are busy with school, friends, and using phones at night. But sleep is very important for the body and mind. Doctors say teenagers should sleep for 8 to 10 hours, but many do not.\n\nIf teenagers don’t sleep well, they may feel tired and sad. They may not do well in school. If this continues, it can cause health problems like getting sick more easily. It’s a good idea to sleep at the same time every night and not look at phones before bed.",

Cooking and raising children must be learned through practice. For many years, women have had more chances to learn, simply because men stayed away. As a result, women often became more skilled, while men missed out. If fathers continue to avoid these roles, they will not only create an unfair burden for women but also limit their own growth.\n\nParenting and cooking are not simple duties. They are creative and enjoyable experiences. Cooking means thinking carefully: what food is left in the refrigerator, what the family enjoys, and how to prepare tomorrow’s lunch. Parenting means sharing joy, solving problems, and teaching children by example. These activities require attention, patience, and imagination. Men should take part not only to support women, but also for themselves. By learning these skills, men become more capable, and the whole family becomes stronger and happier.",

If you study carefully and know your material, you can face tests or speeches with confidence. In addition, a simple breathing exercise can help control stress. One effective method is called 4-2-6 breathing: inhale deeply through your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 2 seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 seconds. Repeat this several times while focusing on keeping your belly relaxed. This kind of abdominal breathing sends a signal to the body to calm down.

They built a network of roads, rivers, and shops in their minds, connecting each point like pieces of a puzzle. This process activated the hippocampus, the brain area that forms spatial memory—the understanding of how one place relates to another.\n\nWith navigation systems, people only follow spoken directions: \"Turn right,\" \"Go straight,\" \"You have arrived.\" They arrive easily but often cannot recall the route later. The brain uses a different, more automatic system, called procedural memory. It is fast but less connected. The map disappears as soon as the trip ends.\n\nThe same pattern appears in studying with AI. When students let AI think for them, they reach the answer without exploring the route. Quick results replace deep understanding. Technology can be a helpful guide, but real learning happens when students use AI to build their own map of ideas—connecting concepts, examples, and reasons in their mind.",
