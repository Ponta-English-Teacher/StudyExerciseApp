    "original": "In the past, people knew each other in person. They met at school, in their neighborhoods, or through friends. They saw each other’s faces, heard their voices, and spent time together. Knowing someone meant sharing time and experiences.\n\nToday, things are different. Many relationships begin and stay online. We chat through messages and see pictures, but we don’t know their faces, their voices, or even if they are real. It’s easy to connect, but it’s hard to truly know someone. The way we know people has changed a lot.",

They send messages and see pictures, but they don’t always know what the other person looks like or sounds like. Sometimes, they don’t even know if the person is real. It’s easy to meet people, but it’s harder to really know them.",
